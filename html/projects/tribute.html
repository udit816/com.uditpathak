      <h1 id="title">Sir Chandrashekhara Venkata Raman</h1>
      <p>Indian physicist who carried out ground-breaking work in the field of light scattering.<br>
        A phenomenon, subsequently known as <strong>Raman scattering</strong>, results from the <strong>Raman effect</strong>.<br> For this he recieved the <strong>Nobel Prize for Physics</strong>.

        <h2>A Timeline of Prof. CV Raman's life and work.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1902</strong> - Raman's father initially taught in a school in Thiruvanaikovil, became a lecturer in mathematics and physics in Mrs. A.V. Narasimha Rao College, Visakhapatnam (then Vishakapatnam) in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, and later joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai). <br>At an early age, Raman moved to the city of Visakhapatnam and studied at St. Aloysius Anglo-Indian High School. Raman passed his matriculation examination at the age of 11 and he passed his F.A. examination (equivalent to today's Intermediate exam, PUCPDC and +2) with a scholarship at the age of 13.  <br>In 1902, Raman joined Presidency College in Madras where his father was a lecturer in mathematics and physics.</li>
          <li><strong>1904</strong> - In 1904 he passed his Bachelor of Arts examination of University of Madras. He stood first and won the gold medal in physics.</li>
          <li><strong>1907</strong> - In 1907 he gained his Master of Sciences degree with the highest distinctions from University of Madras. Also, he was married on 6 May 1907 to Lokasundari Ammal (1892–1980). They had two sons, Chandrasekhar and radio-astronomer Radhakrishnan.</li>
          <li><strong>1916</strong> - Raman had association with the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi; he attended the foundation ceremony of BHU and delivered lectures on "Mathematics" and "Some new paths in physics" during the lecture series organised at BHU from 5 to 8 February 1916. <br>He also held the position of permanent visiting professor at BHU. During his tenure at IISc, he recruited the talented electrical engineering student, G. N. Ramachandran, who later went on to become a distinguished X-ray crystallographer. <br>Raman also worked on the acoustics of musical instruments. He worked out the theory of transverse vibration of bowed strings, on the basis of superposition velocities. He was also the first to investigate the harmonic nature of the sound of the Indian drums such as the tabla and the mridangam. He was also interested in the properties of other musical instruments based on forced vibrations such as the violin. <br>He also investigated the propagation of sound in whispering galleries. Raman's work on acoustics was an important prelude, both experimentally and conceptually, to his later work on optics and quantum mechanics. <br>Raman and his student, Nagendra Nath, provided the correct theoretical explanation for the acousto-optic effect (light scattering by sound waves), in a series of articles resulting in the celebrated Raman–Nath theory. <br>Modulators, and switching systems based on this effect have enabled optical communication components based on laser systems.</li>
          <li><strong>1917</strong> - In the year 1917, Raman resigned from his government service after he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta. At the same time, he continued doing research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Calcutta, where he became the Honorary Secretary. <br>Raman used to refer to this period as the golden era of his career. Many students gathered around him at the IACS and the University of Calcutta.</li>
          <li><strong>1921</strong> - During a voyage to Europe in 1921, Raman noticed the blue colour of glaciers and the Mediterranean sea. He was motivated to discover the reason for the blue colour. Raman carried out experiments regarding the scattering of light by water and transparent blocks of ice which explained the phenomenon. Raman employed monochromatic light from a mercury arc lamp which penetrated transparent material and was allowed to fall on a spectrograph to record its spectrum. He detected lines in the spectrum, which were later called Raman lines.</li>
          <li><strong>1924</strong> - He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career (1924) and knighted in 1929.</li>
          <li><strong>1928</strong> - Raman was confident of winning the Nobel Prize in Physics as well but was disappointed when the Nobel Prize went to Owen Richardson in 1928 and to Louis de Broglie in 1929. <br>On 28 February 1928, Raman led experiments at the IACS with collaborators, including K. S. Krishnan, on the scattering of light, when he discovered what now is called the Raman effect. A detailed account of this period is reported in the biography by G. Venkatraman. It was instantly clear that this discovery was of huge value. It gave further proof of the quantum nature of light. <br>Raman had a complicated professional relationship with K. S. Krishnan, who surprisingly did not share the award, but is mentioned prominently even in the Nobel lecture. <br>India celebrates National Science Day on 28 February of every year to commemorate the discovery of the Raman effect in 1928.<br>He presented his theory at a meeting of scientists in Bangalore on 16 March 1928, and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930. <br>In Munich, some physicists were initially unable to reproduce Raman's results, leading to scepticism. However, Peter Pringsheim was the first German to reproduce Raman's results successfully. He sent spectra to Arnold Sommerfeld. Pringsheim was the first to coin the term "Raman effect" and "Raman lines." </li>
          <li><strong>1929</strong> - Raman spectroscopy came to be based on this phenomenon, and Ernest Rutherford referred to it in his presidential address to the Royal Society in 1929. Raman was president of the 16th session of the Indian Science Congress in 1929. He was conferred a knighthood, and medals and honorary doctorates by various universities.</li>
          <li><strong>1930</strong> - He did eventually win the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the Raman effect". He was the first Asian and first non-white to receive any Nobel Prize in the sciences.</li>
